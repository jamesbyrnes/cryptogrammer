# Cryptogrammer
A cryptogram generator written in React.

Quotes are currently borrowed from 4skinSkywalker/Database-Quotes-JSON purely as an example but you can modify the source to use your own quotes.json file. :)

## Using this repo
This is a `create-react-app` build, so the behaviour is pretty typical.

Run as dev using:
```bash
$ npm start
```

Build to static files using:
```bash
$ npm run-script build
```
